Hunter: You're in some dangerous territory here, kiddo.
Hunter: There's a beast that hunts in these here woods. Not a good place for a kid to be running around.
Hunter: I've seen it - brief flashes, at least. But I never get a good look at the thing. It'd be good to know exactly what it looks like.
Hunter: Would tell us if it has any weaknesses, at least.
Hunter: It would be best if someone who <b>got a good look at the beast could describe it.</b>
Hunter: ...
Hunter: You know someone who has? Good. I have some information I need to hunt it.
